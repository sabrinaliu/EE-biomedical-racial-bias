Spirometry is a clinical test used by physicians to assess the respiratory health of a patient by measuring inhalation and exhalation speed and exhalation volume. By comparing these measurements to set standards, doctors can use the results to diagnose a patient with chronic lung conditions, like asthma, COPD, or pulmonary fibrosis, or just use it as a monitoring tool before surgeries or at a check-up to measure lung health.
